SpaceFlight
===========

Procedurally generated space exploration game

This is honestly the project that I keep coming back to every now and then to chip away at it some more when I get free time. The plans for this game are big. Right now there are simply systems in place, and some things being put together on my local computer, but if you've ever played StarFlight or Star Control... You'll know exactly what to do here.


BUILD INFORMATION
=================
This game won't build for you right now, and that's actually how I want it. You can look at the code and the output, but the version of flixel it runs off of has been modified, and isn't ready to be released.
